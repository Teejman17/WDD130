Semantic Elements

Semantic elements are HTML elements that have a specific meaning and are used to 
structure the content of a web page. They are used to clearly provide meaning to both the 
browser and developer.

Non-semantic Element Examples: <div> and <span> are examples of non-semantic elements. These elements do not provide any semantic meaning to the content they contain, but are commonly used with class or id attributes assigned to them.

Semantic Element Examples: <header>, <nav> <main>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <figure> are some of more common semantic elements. They can be used to identify, with meaning, parts of a web page.

HTML Block and Inline Elements

A Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block" ... Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content

Block-level elements start on a new line on a page and take up the full width of their container. This means the element container stretches out to the left and right as far as it can. Some common block-level elements are: <p> and <div> and all the semantic containers like <header>, <footer>, <main>, <nav>, and <section>.

Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up the space bounded by the tags defining the element. Some common inline elements are: <span>, <a>, <img>, <button>, and <input>.

CSS
Keep CSS and HTML files seperate.

CSS Syntax
CSS rules are made up of a selector and a declaration block { }. The selector is the HTML element(s) you want to style and the declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons (;). Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon (:). The declaration block is enclosed in curly braces.

There are many selector types in CSS. The most common are:

    An HTML Element Selector
    Class Selector
    ID Selector
    Descendant Selector
    Child Selector
    Adjacent Sibling Selector
    General Sibling Selector

The following CSS rule selects all the <h1> elements and sets four properties:

    - the background color of all the <h1> elements to dark blue
    - the text color of the content of all the <h1> elements to white
    - padding or space around the text content of 16 pixels
    = the text is aligned to the center of the <h1> block
        h1 {
        background-color: darkblue;
        color: white;
        padding: 16px;
        text-align: center;
        }
    
    CSS Key Terms:
    Selector — h1
    Declaration Block — { }
    Declaration — background-color: darkblue; (There are four total declarations in this example.)
    Property — background-color
    Value — darkblue
    CSS Rule — the entire block of code
