HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is one of the three core technologies of the web, 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML defines the structure and meaning of a web document. Hypertext 
refers to the way hypertext links are placed in the document that allows users to move from one 
page to another. Markup is a set of symbols or codes for displaying content on the Internet. Web 
browsers, like Google Chrome, use HTML markup and content to render pages.


<!DOCTYPE html>
    This is a development checklist item for all HTML documents produced in this course. 
    These days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document 
    behaves correctly

<html lang="en-US"> ... </html>
    This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root 
    element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.

<head> ... </head>
    The head HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, 
    like its character support, viewport sizing, title, scripts, and style sheets.

    <meta charset="utf-8">
        Located within the <head> element. "This attribute declares the document's character encoding. 
        If the attribute is present, its value must be an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string 
        "utf-8", because UTF-8 is the only valid encoding for HTML5 documents. <meta> elements which 
        declare a character encoding must be located entirely within the first 1024 bytes of the 
        document.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
        Located within the <head> element. "This viewport element ensures the page renders at the 
        width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport 
        and then shrinking them down.

    <title>...</title>
        Located within the <head> element. "This sets the title of your page, which is the title 
        that appears in the browser tab of the page. It is also used to describe the page when you 
        bookmark/favorite it.
        
        The content of the title should closely match the content of the heading 1 <h1> element in 
        the document <body>.

<body> ... </body>
    The <body> HTML element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one 
    body element in a document. It contains all the content that you want to show to web users 
    when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks,
    or whatever else.

Example - What is the basic anatomy of an HTML document?
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en-US">
        <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
        <title>Relevant Document Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>
    </html>

Void Element: Some elements have no content and no closing tag.
    <img src="images/sample.png" alt="A sample image">
    In this class, we follow contemporary recommendations and do NOT include a closing forward 
    slash / in the void element's tag even though doing so works in all browsers.
